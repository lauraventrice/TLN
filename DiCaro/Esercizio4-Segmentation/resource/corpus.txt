31: Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence—perceiving, synthesizing, and inferring information—demonstrated by machines, as opposed to intelligence displayed by animals and humans.
32: Example tasks in which this is done include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between (natural) languages, as well as other mappings of inputs.
33: The Oxford English Dictionary of Oxford University Press defines artificial intelligence as:

the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.
34: AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), automated decision-making and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go).
35: As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.
36: For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an "AI winter"), followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding.
37: AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches since its founding, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge and imitating animal behavior.
38: In the first decades of the 21st century, highly mathematical-statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia.The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools.
39: The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects.
40: General intelligence (the ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals.
41: To solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques – including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability and economics.
42: AI also draws upon computer science, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.
43: The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence "can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it".
44: This raised philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethical consequences of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence; these issues have previously been explored by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity.
45: Computer scientists and philosophers have since suggested that AI may become an existential risk to humanity if its rational capacities are not steered towards beneficial goals.
46: Vincent Willem van Gogh (Dutch: [ˈvɪnsɛnt ˈʋɪləm vɑŋ ˈɣɔx] (listen); 30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who posthumously became one of the most famous and influential figures in Western art history.
47: In a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from the last two years of his life.
48: They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art.
49: Not commercially successful, he struggled with severe depression and poverty, eventually leading to his suicide at age thirty-seven.
50: Born into an upper-middle class family, Van Gogh drew as a child and was serious, quiet, and thoughtful.
51: As a young man, he worked as an art dealer, often traveling, but became depressed after he was transferred to London.
52: He turned to religion and spent time as a Protestant missionary in southern Belgium.
53: He drifted in ill health and solitude before taking up painting in 1881, having moved back home with his parents.
54: His younger brother Theo supported him financially; the two kept a long correspondence by letter.
55: His early works, mostly still lifes and depictions of peasant labourers, contain few signs of the vivid colour that distinguished his later work.
56: In 1886, he moved to Paris, where he met members of the avant-garde, including Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin, who were reacting against the Impressionist sensibility.
57: As his work developed he created a new approach to still lifes and local landscapes.
58: His paintings grew brighter as he developed a style that became fully realised during his stay in Arles in the South of France in 1888.
59: During this period he broadened his subject matter to include series of olive trees, wheat fields and sunflowers.
60: Van Gogh suffered from psychotic episodes and delusions and though he worried about his mental stability, he often neglected his physical health, did not eat properly and drank heavily.
61: His friendship with Gauguin ended after a confrontation with a razor when, in a rage, he severed part of his own left ear.
62: He spent time in psychiatric hospitals, including a period at Saint-Rémy.
63: After he discharged himself and moved to the Auberge Ravoux in Auvers-sur-Oise near Paris, he came under the care of the homeopathic doctor Paul Gachet.
64: His depression persisted, and on 27 July 1890, Van Gogh is believed to have shot himself in the chest with a revolver, dying from his injuries two days later.
65: Van Gogh was commercially unsuccessful during his lifetime, and he was considered a madman and a failure.
66: As he only became famous after his suicide, he came to be seen as a misunderstood genius in the public imagination.
67: His reputation grew in the early 20th century as elements of his style came to be incorporated by the Fauves and German Expressionists.
68: He attained widespread critical and commercial success over the ensuing decades, and is remembered as an important but tragic painter whose troubled personality typifies the romantic ideal of the tortured artist.
69: Today, Van Gogh's works are among the world's most expensive paintings to have ever sold, and his legacy is honoured by a museum in his name, the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, which holds the world's largest collection of his paintings and drawings.
70: Cubism is an early-20th-century avant-garde art movement that revolutionized European painting and sculpture, and inspired related movements in music, literature and architecture.
71: In Cubist artwork, objects are analyzed, broken up and reassembled in an abstracted form—instead of depicting objects from a single viewpoint, the artist depicts the subject from a multitude of viewpoints to represent the subject in a greater context.
72: Cubism has been considered the most influential art movement of the 20th century.
73: The term is broadly used in association with a wide variety of art produced in Paris (Montmartre and Montparnasse) or near Paris (Puteaux) during the 1910s and throughout the 1920s.
74: The movement was pioneered by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, and joined by Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay, Henri Le Fauconnier, Juan Gris, and Fernand Léger.
75: One primary influence that led to Cubism was the representation of three-dimensional form in the late works of Paul Cézanne.
76: A retrospective of Cézanne's paintings was held at the Salon d'Automne of 1904, current works were displayed at the 1905 and 1906 Salon d'Automne, followed by two commemorative retrospectives after his death in 1907.In France, offshoots of Cubism developed, including Orphism, abstract art and later Purism.
77: The impact of Cubism was far-reaching and wide-ranging.
78: In France and other countries Futurism, Suprematism, Dada, Constructivism, Vorticism, De Stijl and Art Deco developed in response to Cubism.
79: Early Futurist paintings hold in common with Cubism the fusing of the past and the present, the representation of different views of the subject pictured at the same time or successively, also called multiple perspective, simultaneity or multiplicity, while Constructivism was influenced by Picasso's technique of constructing sculpture from separate elements.
80: Other common threads between these disparate movements include the faceting or simplification of geometric forms, and the association of mechanization and modern life.
