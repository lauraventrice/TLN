# TLN Project
Development of the project for Natural Language Technologies course at University of Turin.

The course main focus is about the basic elements on modern technologies for Natural Language Processing and is arranged into
three main components: 
- basics of natural language processing, with special focus on: morphology, syntax, formal semantics, NL generation and automatic translation;
- Lexical Semantics with several approaches for Knowledge Representation, along with the notion of semantics based on conceptual anchoring. Is also a detailed survey on the existing, state-of-the-art and semantic resources.
- statistical approaches to NLP, starting from the concept of distributional semantics and the existing methodologies. The focus is then on the notion of semantic similarity and the theoretical bases for the construction of meaning through syntactic-semantic compositions, with an emphasis on the automatic construction of ontologies.


Each part has is own project with a README.md, where considerations, resources and results obtained are included.
