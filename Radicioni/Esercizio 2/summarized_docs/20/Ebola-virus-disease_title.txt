The Trump wall commonly referred to as The Wall was an expansion of the Mexico United States barrier during the U S presidency of Donald Trump Throughout his 2016 presidential campaign Trump called for the construction of a border wall He said that if elected he would build the wall and make Mexico pay for it Then Mexican president Enrique Pe a Nieto said that Mexico would not pay for the wall 
In January 2017 Trump signed Executive Order 13767 which formally directed the U S government to begin wall construction along the U S Mexico border using existing federal funding After a political struggle for funding including an appropriations lapse resulting in a government shutdown for 35 days and the declaration of a national emergency construction started in 2019 
The U S built new barriers along 455 miles 49 miles of which previously had no barrier Much of the remainder consists of 30 foot tall steel fencing where previously there had been smaller fencing to deter automobiles Additionally a private organization called We Build the Wall constructed under five miles 8 0 km of new wall on private property near El Paso Texas with Trump s encouragement 
Initially On January 20 2021 newly inaugurated U S president Joe Biden terminated the national emergency and halted construction of the wall but the Secretary of Homeland Security later hinted that the construction of the wall may continue under Biden s administration 
The Mexico United States barrier is a series of vertical barriers along the Mexico United States border aimed at preventing illegal crossings from Mexico into the United States The barrier is not one contiguous structure but a discontinuous series of physical obstructions variously classified as fences or walls 
Between the physical barriers security is provided by a virtual fence of sensors cameras and other surveillance equipment used to dispatch United States Border Patrol agents to suspected migrant crossings As of January 2009 U S Customs and Border Protection reported that it had more than 580 miles 930 km of barriers in place The total length of the continental border is 1 954 miles 3 145 km 
Structure 
In February 2017 Trump said the wall is getting designed right here but did not offer specifics In March 2017 U S Customs and Border Protection CBP began accepting prototype ideas for a U S Mexico border wall from companies and said it would issue a request for proposals by March 24 
In June 2017 Trump said his proposed border wall should be covered with solar panels as a means of making beautiful structures and helping pay for the wall This suggestion was criticized by some as illogical or impracticable Albert Pope of the Rice University School of Architecture of Houston Texas noted that solar farms cannot be efficiently dispersed along a wall Others including John Griese co owner of the solar installation firm Elemental Energy estimated a profit of over 100 million per year from such panels In July Trump said the wall should be transparent to detect smugglers who throw the large sacks of drugs over 
A manufacturing company based in Pine City Minnesota was awarded a bid to help build the virtual wall along the border in 2018 Instead of using physical walls this plan for a virtual wall would involve easily transportable roll up towers with attached motion sensing and camera equipment While initially small and mobile when deployed the internal structure of the tower telescopes upwards to create a tall surveillance apparatus Along remote parts of the border this method could be cheaper and more practical than building permanent structures on location 
Cost estimates 
Early estimates 
Considerations 
One time costs include land acquisition and construction of new or replacement fence ongoing costs include maintenance of existing fence and Border Patrol agents who guard the area Rough and remote terrain on many parts of the border such as deserts and mountains would make construction and maintenance of a wall expensive On federally protected wilderness areas and Native American reservations the Department of Homeland Security may have only limited construction authority and a wall could cause environmental damage 
Outcome 
As of December 2020 the total funding given for new fencing was about 15 billion a third of which had been given by Congress while Trump had ordered the rest taken from the military budget This funding was intended to build new fencing over 738 miles 1 188 km at a cost of about 20 million per mile this would cover a little more than half the approximately 1 300 mi 2 100 km that had no fencing when Trump took office 
A March 2021 review of the Trump work on the wall found found only 47 miles 76 km of new barriers where none had previously existed While Trump had described the new wall as virtually impenetrable it was found that smugglers had repeatedly sawed through the wall with cheap power tools Also new dirt roads that had been used to access the wall construction served as new access roads for smugglers 
Different sources draw different conclusions about the actual or likely effectiveness of the wall Research at Texas A M University and Texas Tech University indicated that the wall and border walls in general are unlikely to be effective at reducing illegal immigration or movement of contraband By contrast the American Economic Journal found that wall construction caused a 15 35 percent reduction in migration varying with proximity to the barrier
