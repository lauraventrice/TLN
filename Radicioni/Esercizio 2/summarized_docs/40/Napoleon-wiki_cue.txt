In January 2017 Trump signed Executive Order 13767 which formally directed the U S government to begin wall construction along the U S Mexico border using existing federal funding After a political struggle for funding including an appropriations lapse resulting in a government shutdown for 35 days and the declaration of a national emergency construction started in 2019 
The U S built new barriers along 455 miles 49 miles of which previously had no barrier Much of the remainder consists of 30 foot tall steel fencing where previously there had been smaller fencing to deter automobiles Additionally a private organization called We Build the Wall constructed under five miles 8 0 km of new wall on private property near El Paso Texas with Trump s encouragement 
Initially On January 20 2021 newly inaugurated U S president Joe Biden terminated the national emergency and halted construction of the wall but the Secretary of Homeland Security later hinted that the construction of the wall may continue under Biden s administration 
Background 
The Mexico United States barrier is a series of vertical barriers along the Mexico United States border aimed at preventing illegal crossings from Mexico into the United States The barrier is not one contiguous structure but a discontinuous series of physical obstructions variously classified as fences or walls 
The concept for the proposed expansion was developed by campaign advisers Sam Nunberg and Roger Stone in 2014 as a memorable talking point Trump could use to tie his business experience as a builder and developer to his immigration policy proposals The wall was first aired in January 2015 at the Iowa Freedom Summit hosted by Citizens United and Steve King Trump proposed it again at Trump s June 2015 announcement speech for his 2015 2016 presidential campaign along with a claim that Mexico would pay for it Trump has repeated the claim many times 
In February 2017 Trump said the wall is getting designed right here but did not offer specifics In March 2017 U S Customs and Border Protection CBP began accepting prototype ideas for a U S Mexico border wall from companies and said it would issue a request for proposals by March 24 
In June 2017 Trump said his proposed border wall should be covered with solar panels as a means of making beautiful structures and helping pay for the wall This suggestion was criticized by some as illogical or impracticable Albert Pope of the Rice University School of Architecture of Houston Texas noted that solar farms cannot be efficiently dispersed along a wall Others including John Griese co owner of the solar installation firm Elemental Energy estimated a profit of over 100 million per year from such panels In July Trump said the wall should be transparent to detect smugglers who throw the large sacks of drugs over 
A manufacturing company based in Pine City Minnesota was awarded a bid to help build the virtual wall along the border in 2018 Instead of using physical walls this plan for a virtual wall would involve easily transportable roll up towers with attached motion sensing and camera equipment While initially small and mobile when deployed the internal structure of the tower telescopes upwards to create a tall surveillance apparatus Along remote parts of the border this method could be cheaper and more practical than building permanent structures on location 
Trump requested that the wall be painted black despite the protests of military leaders and border officials who call it unnecessary Painting the wall is expected to cost between 500 million and 3 billion
