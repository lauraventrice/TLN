The Trump wall commonly referred to as The Wall was an expansion of the Mexico United States barrier during the U S presidency of Donald Trump Throughout his 2016 presidential campaign Trump called for the construction of a border wall He said that if elected he would build the wall and make Mexico pay for it Then Mexican president Enrique Pe a Nieto said that Mexico would not pay for the wall 
Initially On January 20 2021 newly inaugurated U S president Joe Biden terminated the national emergency and halted construction of the wall but the Secretary of Homeland Security later hinted that the construction of the wall may continue under Biden s administration 
Background 
The Mexico United States barrier is a series of vertical barriers along the Mexico United States border aimed at preventing illegal crossings from Mexico into the United States The barrier is not one contiguous structure but a discontinuous series of physical obstructions variously classified as fences or walls 
The concept for the proposed expansion was developed by campaign advisers Sam Nunberg and Roger Stone in 2014 as a memorable talking point Trump could use to tie his business experience as a builder and developer to his immigration policy proposals The wall was first aired in January 2015 at the Iowa Freedom Summit hosted by Citizens United and Steve King Trump proposed it again at Trump s June 2015 announcement speech for his 2015 2016 presidential campaign along with a claim that Mexico would pay for it Trump has repeated the claim many times 
Structure
