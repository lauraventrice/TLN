The Trump wall commonly referred to as The Wall was an expansion of the Mexico United States barrier during the U S presidency of Donald Trump Throughout his 2016 presidential campaign Trump called for the construction of a border wall He said that if elected he would build the wall and make Mexico pay for it Then Mexican president Enrique Pe a Nieto said that Mexico would not pay for the wall 
In January 2017 Trump signed Executive Order 13767 which formally directed the U S government to begin wall construction along the U S Mexico border using existing federal funding After a political struggle for funding including an appropriations lapse resulting in a government shutdown for 35 days and the declaration of a national emergency construction started in 2019 
Initially On January 20 2021 newly inaugurated U S president Joe Biden terminated the national emergency and halted construction of the wall but the Secretary of Homeland Security later hinted that the construction of the wall may continue under Biden s administration 
Background 
Fence between San Diego s border patrol offices in California left and Tijuana Mexico 
The Mexico United States barrier is a series of vertical barriers along the Mexico United States border aimed at preventing illegal crossings from Mexico into the United States The barrier is not one contiguous structure but a discontinuous series of physical obstructions variously classified as fences or walls 
Between the physical barriers security is provided by a virtual fence of sensors cameras and other surveillance equipment used to dispatch United States Border Patrol agents to suspected migrant crossings As of January 2009 U S Customs and Border Protection reported that it had more than 580 miles 930 km of barriers in place The total length of the continental border is 1 954 miles 3 145 km 
The concept for the proposed expansion was developed by campaign advisers Sam Nunberg and Roger Stone in 2014 as a memorable talking point Trump could use to tie his business experience as a builder and developer to his immigration policy proposals The wall was first aired in January 2015 at the Iowa Freedom Summit hosted by Citizens United and Steve King Trump proposed it again at Trump s June 2015 announcement speech for his 2015 2016 presidential campaign along with a claim that Mexico would pay for it Trump has repeated the claim many times 
Wall prototypes being presented to President Trump in San Diego March 2018 
In February 2017 Trump said the wall is getting designed right here but did not offer specifics In March 2017 U S Customs and Border Protection CBP began accepting prototype ideas for a U S Mexico border wall from companies and said it would issue a request for proposals by March 24 
The Associated Press reported that more than two hundred organizations had expressed interest in designing and building the wall for CBP By April 2017 several companies had released their proposed designs to the public CBP does not publicly release bids and intends to name only the winning bid The proposals included placing solar panels along part of a wall placing artwork along the wall a polished concrete wall augmented with stones and artifacts related to the local region incorporating ballistics resistance technology and sensors for above ground and below ground penetration and the creation of a co nation where the border is maintained by both countries in an open status 
In September 2017 the U S government announced the start of construction of eight prototype barriers made from concrete and other materials On June 3 2018 the San Diego section of wall construction began On October 26 a two mile stretch of steel bollards in Calexico California was commemorated as the first section of Trump s wall although media coverage heavily debated whether it should be considered a wall or a fence Trump scheduled a visit to this section in April 2019 
A manufacturing company based in Pine City Minnesota was awarded a bid to help build the virtual wall along the border in 2018 Instead of using physical walls this plan for a virtual wall would involve easily transportable roll up towers with attached motion sensing and camera equipment While initially small and mobile when deployed the internal structure of the tower telescopes upwards to create a tall surveillance apparatus Along remote parts of the border this method could be cheaper and more practical than building permanent structures on location 
In 2013 a Bloomberg Government analysis estimated that it would cost up to 28 billion annually to seal the border While campaigning for the presidency in early 2016 Trump claimed it would be a one time cost of only 8 billion while Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said 15 billion and the Trump administration s own early estimates ranged up to 25 billion The Department of Homeland Security s internal estimate in early 2017 shortly after Trump took office was that his proposed border wall would cost 21 6 billion and take 3 5 years to build
