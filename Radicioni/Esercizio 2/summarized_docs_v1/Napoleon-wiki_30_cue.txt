In January 2017 Trump signed Executive Order 13767 which formally directed the U S government to begin wall construction along the U S Mexico border using existing federal funding After a political struggle for funding including an appropriations lapse resulting in a government shutdown for 35 days and the declaration of a national emergency construction started in 2019 
The U S built new barriers along 455 miles 49 miles of which previously had no barrier Much of the remainder consists of 30 foot tall steel fencing where previously there had been smaller fencing to deter automobiles Additionally a private organization called We Build the Wall constructed under five miles 8 0 km of new wall on private property near El Paso Texas with Trump s encouragement 
Initially On January 20 2021 newly inaugurated U S president Joe Biden terminated the national emergency and halted construction of the wall but the Secretary of Homeland Security later hinted that the construction of the wall may continue under Biden s administration 
Background 
Fence between San Diego s border patrol offices in California left and Tijuana Mexico 
The Mexico United States barrier is a series of vertical barriers along the Mexico United States border aimed at preventing illegal crossings from Mexico into the United States The barrier is not one contiguous structure but a discontinuous series of physical obstructions variously classified as fences or walls 
Between the physical barriers security is provided by a virtual fence of sensors cameras and other surveillance equipment used to dispatch United States Border Patrol agents to suspected migrant crossings As of January 2009 U S Customs and Border Protection reported that it had more than 580 miles 930 km of barriers in place The total length of the continental border is 1 954 miles 3 145 km 
Structure 
The Associated Press reported that more than two hundred organizations had expressed interest in designing and building the wall for CBP By April 2017 several companies had released their proposed designs to the public CBP does not publicly release bids and intends to name only the winning bid The proposals included placing solar panels along part of a wall placing artwork along the wall a polished concrete wall augmented with stones and artifacts related to the local region incorporating ballistics resistance technology and sensors for above ground and below ground penetration and the creation of a co nation where the border is maintained by both countries in an open status 
In September 2017 the U S government announced the start of construction of eight prototype barriers made from concrete and other materials On June 3 2018 the San Diego section of wall construction began On October 26 a two mile stretch of steel bollards in Calexico California was commemorated as the first section of Trump s wall although media coverage heavily debated whether it should be considered a wall or a fence Trump scheduled a visit to this section in April 2019 
Trump requested that the wall be painted black despite the protests of military leaders and border officials who call it unnecessary Painting the wall is expected to cost between 500 million and 3 billion
